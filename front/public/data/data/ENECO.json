    "Objectifs du module": "This course aims at giving students an overview of the New Energy Economics (dealing with liberalized and globalized energy markets) focusing on the issue of infrastructure. It examines public policies affecting energy markets (with a focus on electricity market) and infrastructure (generation mix and security of supply). Adopting an IO perspective, it presents the supply chain value of the gas and electricity system, the competition, the market design, the regulation and the new business models of these industries, so as to better understand the context of investment decisions. It studies the future challenges of energy sector based on the innovations that will deeply transform offer and supply conditions of energy and impact investment decision (smart grids, big data, storage batteries for electricity, CO2 capture and storage). CBA is often used in the energy sector but need to be adapted to the technical, regulatory, political specificities of the gas and electricity systems, notably when the projects are developed as demonstrators (typically for smart grid projects).
