    "Objectifs du module": "This course is designed from the perspective of practicing managers and is about understanding, coping with, and proactively managing strategic change, i.e. major alterations in organizational direction, scope, capability etc. Change has always been part of being in business but there is an increased emphasis today, particularly as globalization and technology (e.g. the Internet) are transforming the strategic landscape. There is an almost inevitable link between an organization\u2019s ongoing responses to change and its abilities to survive and thrive. The \u201cold-fashioned\u201d organization can quickly become the out-moded one and be absorbed by more adapted predators or simply become extinct.",
    "Programme du module": "The course combines lectures, readings, exercises, cases, and films and gears itself to the strategies of change agents in organizations. Its focus is to help individuals develop analytical, strategic and political skills necessary to tackle change in organizational settings (private, public, etc.). We will be focusing not simply on the abstract notion of change, but on the pragmatics of how to get things done in an organization. How do you actually put change in place? How do you develop an agenda? How do you assess the allies and resistors? How do you engage in the micropolitics that are necessary for creating change in organizations? The course will have some case material, a sufficient amount of academic readings, some films, and plenty of opportunity for group work and discussion.",
