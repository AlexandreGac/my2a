    "Objectifs du module": "Since electricity cannot be stored in large quantities at low costs, the equilibrium of electric grids must be guaranteed at all times. A permanent optimization of the demand vs supply is needed. The rapid growth of intermittent energies such as wind and solar, the development of electric vehicles and of self-consumption as well as new business models for electricity sales, create new risks for the grids and potential benefits. Learning objectives: \u2022 analyze, explain and debate the energy context of a project \u2022 understand the specifity of electricity and the technological and economic evolutions related to electricity \u2022 understand and adopt technical strategies and business models adapted to the context",
