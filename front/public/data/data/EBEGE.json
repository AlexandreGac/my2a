    "Programme du module": "The course is divided into three sections. The first section analyses the economic rationale behind the move towards greater reliance on competition and the market system in the management of the economy. The second section deals with macro-stability (price stability and sound government finances) as a foundation for sustainable economic growth. Attention is given to the linkage between macro-stability and the business environment. The third section addresses openness and globalization, including the economic effects of trade liberalization, multinational investment, immigration and capital mobility and the main elements of exchange rate policy.",
