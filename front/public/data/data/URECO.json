    "Objectifs du module": "This course provides an overview of urban economics and explains how to conduct local policy evaluation with the help of concrete examples drawn from the economic literature. The working of the city will be examined with stylized facts and lectures on agglomeration economies, urban mechanisms and equilibrium effects. Motivations for urban policies will then be developed and programs meant to foster development and help the poor will be discussed. An emphasis will be put on evaluation methods such as difference-in-differences and propensity score matching. Programs examined in more detail will include the implementation of enterprise zones, urban renovation tools, support for residential mobility, and transportation policies.
