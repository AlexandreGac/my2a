    "Objectifs du module": "The aim of this course is to provide the students with the sociological knowledge and toolbox necessary to navigate in organizations, gain the support of key stakeholders and achieve their projects. It helps understand and thus, influence organizational functioning, decision making and collective action. A mix of theoretical inputs, practical examples and games illustrates basic notions on human action in organizations, - whether individual or collective -, power, decision-making and control, as well as culture, cooperation and efficiency. The students are also taught a method of organizational diagnosis called Strategic Analysis of Organizations (or stakeholders\u2019 analysis) useful for problem solving and change management. This method is applied on case studies and if possible, on the capstone projects. Evaluation: Homework and project based on the capstone. References: Dupuy F., 2018, Are we all lost in management?
