    "Objectifs du module": "The aim of this course is to provide students with the fundamental concepts and methods of cost- benefit analyses (CBA). The first part of the course derives the theoretical foundations of the main concepts behind cost-benefit analyses. It provides the necessary toolkit for understanding CBAs. The second part of the course focuses on empirical issues (e.g. methods for the valuation of non-market goods, quantitative methods for ex post evaluation). In order to familiarize with academic research and get a sense of how its results may be used in practice, students will be asked to prepare (by groups of 2 or 3) an oral presentation discussing a journal article.
