    "Objectifs du module": "This course aims to introduce students to transport economics, and to the use of cost-benefit analysis in the transport sector. The key notions of transport economics are first presented (e.g. travel demand, generalized cost of travel, value of time\u2026). Then, students are taught how cost-benefit analysis puts all these notions to use. Several related issues are covered, such as the place of cost-benefit analysis in the design and evaluation of transport projects, governance\u2026. The course addresses basic theoretical aspects as well as methodological aspects (travel demand modelling, emergence of big data in transport studies and in economic appraisal\u2026). Several case studies are also discussed (Grand Paris Express, London\u2019s Crossrail\u2026). Evaluation: The course will be evaluated based on a class presentation (50% of the final mark), home assignments (25%) and attendance and involvement during classes (25%) References: Varian, (2014), Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach, Ninth International Student Edition.
