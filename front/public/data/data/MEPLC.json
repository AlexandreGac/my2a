    "Objectifs du module": "With approximately 35% of total greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in 2010, the energy supply sector is the largest contributor to climate change, with an annual rate of GHG-emissions growth reaching 3% (Bruckner et al 2014). Consequently, pressure for the design of low-GHG energies is increasing, calling for the application of suitable environmental methodologies such as life cycle assessment. The main objective of the approach is to inform technological choices, by identifying environmental improvements that do not transfer environmental burdens along the value chain or from an environmental damage to another. This course aims to enable energy project managers to understand LCA methodology, identify critical points, and apply life cycle thinking when designing energy projects. Learning bjectives: \u2022 to anticipate requirements for LCA expertise \u2022 to understand LCA methodology and critical points \u2022 to understand and critically examine existing LCA studies (by identifying assumptions and key parameters) \u2022 to perform a simple life cycle assessment using common and available tools (Excel, OpenLCA), \u2022 to discuss the robustness and the uncertainties of LCA results \u2022 to identify environmentally and economically sound options, and discuss possible rebound effects",
