Students will know the articulation between financial regulation and supervision and they will know the main stakeholders of this ecosystem. They will also know the key aspects of the framework and instruments of financial regulation and supervision for sustainable finance that have been developed at the French and EU levels (and how this connects with the international level). These instruments include for example climate stress-testing of the banks. In particular, students will be able to understand and manipulate two main objectives of financial regulation: financial stability and proper functioning of the markets. They will be able to present and discuss the links between climate and these traditional objectives of financial regulation. They will also be able to elaborate on the challenges related to the integration of climate issues in the objectives and instruments of financial regulation and supervision.",
