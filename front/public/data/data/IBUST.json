These two levels of strategic management determine the basic structure of the course. At business level we will start by discussing the concept of competitive advantage which is a crucial element of every strategy option. Defining a strategy relies on analytical foundations as well as creative ideas. Both dimensions of strategy formulation will be covered. At corporate level the link between shareholders' objectives and corporate strategy is the key issue. Adding value to businesses is the main challenge of corporate strategy and the concept of parenting advantage links value creation and strategy making. A framework for strategy formulation at corporate level including portfolio planning and resource allocation will be discussed. In addition to that we will deal with options to execute portfolio changes - e.g. acquisitions and strategic alliances.",
